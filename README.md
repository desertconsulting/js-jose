Overview
--------
JavaScript library to sign/verify and encrypt/decrypt data in JSON Web Signatures
and Web Encryption (JWE) formats. This library is designed to work in the browser
(tested in Chrome 38). It can do RSA-based public/private crypto as well 
as shared key encryption.

Both JWE and JWS are encapsulation formats which makes it easy to share signatures 
and ciphertext between different platforms: data signed or encrypted in a browser
can be verified or decrypted in Go, Java, etc.

The library uses compact representation. There is therefore no support for
multiple recipients in JWE messages. It should be easy to add that if needed.

The library partially supports extra headers.

The library uses the Web Crypto API, which is available in recent browsers
(http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography). As of March 2015, it seems ~68%
of users have some form of Web Crypto support.

This code has been tested in Chrome 38 and is compatible with the [Golang
implementation](https://github.com/square/go-jose).

JSON web encryption is currently a set of drafts. This code is based on the
following drafts:

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-40
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-40
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-41

U.S. Export Administration Regulations. You may not export, re-export, transfer
or download this code or any part of it in violation of any United States law,

Example encryption
------------------

    <script src="jose-jwe.min.js"></script>
    var joseJWE = new JoseJWE();
    var rsa_key = JoseJWE.Utils.importRsaPublicKey({
    	"n": "c2:4b:af:0f:2d:2b:ad:36:72:a7:91:0f:ee:30:a0:95:d5:3a:46:82:86:96:7e:42:c6:fe:8f:20:97:af:49:f6:48:a3:91:53:ac:2e:e6:ec:9a:9a:e0:0a:fb:1c:db:44:40:5b:8c:fc:d5:1c:cb:b6:9b:60:c0:a8:ac:06:f1:6b:29:5e:2f:7b:09:d9:93:32:da:3f:db:53:9c:2e:ea:3b:41:7f:6b:c9:7b:88:9f:2e:c5:dd:42:1e:7f:8f:04:f6:60:3c:fe:43:6d:32:10:ce:8d:99:cb:76:f7:10:97:05:af:28:1e:39:0f:78:35:50:7b:8e:28:22:a4:7d:11:51:22:d1:0e:ab:6b:6f:96:cb:cf:7d:eb:c6:aa:a2:6a:2e:97:2a:93:af:a5:89:e6:c8:bc:9f:fd:85:2b:0f:b4:c0:e4:ca:b5:a7:9a:01:05:81:93:6b:f5:8d:1c:f7:f3:77:0e:6e:53:34:92:0f:48:21:34:33:44:14:5e:4a:00:41:3a:7d:cb:38:82:c1:65:e0:79:ea:a1:05:84:b2:6e:40:19:77:1a:0e:38:4b:28:1f:34:b5:cb:ac:c5:2f:58:51:d7:ec:a8:08:0e:7c:c0:20:c1:5e:a1:4d:b1:30:17:63:0e:e7:58:8e:7f:6e:9f:a4:77:8b:1e:a2:d2:2e:1b:e9",
        "e": 65537
    });
    joseJWE.encrypt(rsa_key, "hello world").then(function(result) {
    	console.log(result);
    }).catch(function(err){
    	console.error(err);
    });

Example signature
-----------------

Algorithms exposed by this library
----------------------------------
Signatures:

* RSA-256 (default)

Key Encryption:

* RSA-OAEP (default)
* RSA-OAEP-256
* A128KW (supported, but not recommended for use)
* A256KW (supported, but not recommended for use)

Algorithms not exposed (and reason why)
---------------------------------------

* DIR (could be added if deemed useful, would require little work)
* PBES2-HS256+A128KW (would require implementing PBES2)
* PBES2-HS512+A256KW (would require implementing PBES2)
* RSAES-PKCS1-v_5 was removed in Chrome (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=372920)
* PBES2-HS384+A192KW (AES with 192-bit keys isn't supported in Chrome)
* A192KW (AES with 192-bit keys isn't supported in Chrome)
* ECDH-ES (Chrome and IE currently don't support it)
* ECDH-ES+A128KW (Chrome and IE currently don't support it)
* ECDH-ES+A192KW (Chrome and IE currently don't support it)
* ECDH-ES+A256KW (Chrome and IE currently don't support it)
* RSA-PSS, ECDSA (could be added once Chrome supports these)


Building

    npm install
    grunt


Some background info
--------------------

The Web Crypto API is still pretty new and isn't always very well documented.
The following resources are useful:

* [www.w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/)
* [msdn.microsoft.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn302338(v=vs.85).aspx)
* [docs.google.com](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/blink/webcrypto)
* [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)

Note: Internet Explorer's Web Crypto API differs from Chrome's (as it was
implemented against an earlier version of the ietf draft). We will either
need to implement a thin abstraction layer or [wait for Microsoft to update
things](https://status.modern.ie/webcryptoapi?term=crypto).
